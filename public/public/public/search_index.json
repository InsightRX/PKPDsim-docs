documentationPKPDsim is an R package for numerical integration of ODE systems, in particular pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) mixed-effects models.In pharmacometrics, models are often defined as systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Although solving ODEs numerically in R is relatively straightforward using e.g. the deSolve library, the implementation of e.g. infusions and complex dosing regimens as well as the incorporation of random effects is cumbersome. Outside of R, a tool like Berkeley Madonna provides excellent interactivity features and is fast, but is much inferior to R regarding plotting functionality, cumbersome regarding implementation of dose regimens and multi-level variability, and also not open source.In short, the issues above were the impetus for developing the PKPDsim library in R. For fast numerical integration of the ODEs, the module uses the Boost C++ library under the hood.If this library is useful to you in your company or academic work, please let me know at @ronpirana. For any suggestions on new features or to report any bugs, please don't send me emails but open an issue on GitHub.PKPDsim is released under the MIT open source license."},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting started","keywords":"","body":"Getting startedInstallationAt current, PKPDsim is not yet on CRAN (but it will be released to there soon). So you cannot use install.packages() yet to install it. However, the package can be installed directly from GitHub when you have the devtools package installed:library(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"ronkeizer/PKPDsim\")\nlibrary(PKPDsim)\nFirst simulationThe main simulation function in PKPDsim is sim_ode(). To be able to simulate a dosing regimen for a specific drug, at least the following three arguments are required:model: the model (created using the new_ode_model() function)\n\nparameters: a list of parameter values for the model\n\nregimen: the dosing regimen (created using the new_regimen() function)\n\nThe model library in PKPDsim contains a small selection of PK and PD models, but the main strength of course is it's ability to handle user-specified ODE systems. However, as a first example, let's implement the most simple example:p \nYou probably noticed that the new_ode_model()-step took a few seconds to finish, while the simulation itself was in the order of milliseconds. In new_ode_model, the model is compiled to C++ binary code, which takes a few seconds. However, this has to be done only once. After compilation, the model is then available to be used in sim_ode() for as long as the R session is open.So let's look at the output.

It defines the ODE system and sets some attributes for the model. The model can be specified in three different ways:model: a string that references a model from the library included in PKPDsim. Examples in the current library are e.g. pk_1cmt_oral, pk_2cmt_iv. To show the available models, run new_ode_model() without any arguments.\n\ncode: using code specyfing derivatives for ODE specified in pseudo-R code\n\nfile: similar to code, but reads the code from a file\n\nModel from libraryFor example, a 1-compartment oral PK model can be obtained using:pk1 \nRun the new_ode_model() function without arguments to see the currently available models:> new_ode_model()\n  Either a model name (from the PKPDsim library), ODE code, an R function, or\n  a file containing code for the ODE system have to be supplied to this function.\n  The following models are available:\n  pk_1cmt_iv\n  pk_1cmt_iv_auc\n  pk_1cmt_iv_mm\n  pk_2cmt_iv\n  pk_2cmt_iv_auc\n  pk_1cmt_oral\nCustom model from codeThe custom model needs to be specified as a string or text block:pk1 \nThe input code should adhere to the follow rules:the derivaties in the ODE system are defined using dAdt\n\narray indices for the derivatives and compartments are indicated with [ ] and start at 1.\n\nequations are defined using =\n\nsome expections apply, e.g. power functions (see below).\n\nThe input code is translated into a C++ function. You can check that the model compiled correctly by typing the model name on the R command line, which prints the model information:> pk1\nODE definition:\n\n  double   KEL = CL/V;\n  dAdt[0] = -KA * A[0] + rate;\n  dAdt[1] = +KA * A[1] -KEL * A[1];\n  ;\n\nRequired parameters: CL, V, KA\nNumber of compartments: 2\nObservation compartment: 1\nDependent variable scaling: 1\nIf you want even more detailed information, you can also print the actual C++ function that is used under-the-hood by specifying the cpp_show_code=TRUE argument to the new_ode_model() function.More custom model optionsYou can introduce new variables in your code, but you will have to define them using declare_variables argument too:pk1 \nAlso, when you want to use covariates in your ODE system (more info on how to define covariates is in the Covariates section), you will have to define them, both in the code and in the function call:pk1 \nOne exception to the input code syntax is the definition of power functions. PKPDsim does not translate those from the pseudo-R code to valid C++ syntax automatically. C/C++ does not use the ^ to indicate power functions but uses the pow(value, base) function instead, so e.g. an allometric model should be written as:pk1 \nDosingThe default dosing compartment and bioavailability can be specified using the dose argument. By default, the dose will go into compartment 1, with a bioavailability of 1. The bioav element in the list can be either a number or a character string referring a parameter.pk1 \nObservationsThe observation compartment can be set by specifying a list to the obs argument, with the elements obs and scale.pk1 \nThe scale can be either a parameter or a number, the cmt can only be a number.Note that the variables specified inside the differential equation block are not available as scaling parameters. E.g. for allometry you will have to redefine the scaled volume as follows:pk1 \nCustom model from fileThe same syntax as explained above applies, but using the file= argument the input code is read from the specified file. This is just a convenience function, i.e. it allows you to modularize your code, and separate models and R code.pk1 \n"},"regimen.html":{"url":"regimen.html","title":"Regimen","keywords":"","body":"RegimenRegimens are defined using the new_regimen() function. You should provide information on the dose amount, how many doses, and the dosing interval. However, how you provide that information is very flexible. You can e.g. specify:reg1 \nwhich will administer 5 doses of 100 mg (or whatever the unit is), at an interval of 12 hours. The same can however also be specified as:reg1 \nor:reg1 \nBe careful: if the length of the amt vector is not the same as the lenght in times, the function will repeat the first amt specified. The same goes for the arguments type, cmt, and t_inf.By default, the new_regimen_function() function assumes the dose is given as bolus. If you want to specify that these should be given as infusion, use the following:reg1 \nWhen you created the model using new_ode_model, you also specified a default dosing compartment. If you didn't specify the dose argument, the default dosing compartment is 1. Now, should you want to administer the dose into a different compartment, you can override it with the cmt argumentfunction:reg1 \nWhich will administer the doses to compartments 1, 1, 2, 2, and 3, respectively (of course this is a hypothetical example).Note: PKPDsim doesn't care about what unit the dose is in, you have to define this yourself in conjunction with the model code and observation scale.Steady stateInstead of simulating the full concentration time course for a give model,\nif you want to simulate the PK(PD) at steady state, you can also specify\nthe ss=TRUE argument to new_regimen(), which will then simulate the\nregimen at steady state. By default, steady state is assumed to occur after\n5 days (PKPDsim doesn't check if steady state is reached!), but if you want\nto decrease or increase this you can do so by specifying the n_ss argument\nwhich takes the number of doses to simulate before assuming steady state."},"parameters.html":{"url":"parameters.html","title":"Parameters","keywords":"","body":"ParametersParameters are just specified as a list object in R.

ALternatively, the \\Omega could also have been defined as:dat \nOr using the coefficient of variation and without correlation between parameters:dat \nNote that using the cv_to_omega function assumes the CV is on the SD-scale and not on the variance scale (and the definition of CV uses the assumption 1 + \\eta \\approx 1 * \\exp(\\eta)).Variability typeBy default, PKPDsim will assume exponential distribution of all parameters if omega is specified. If normal distribution is desired for all parameters, please use the omega_type=\"normal\" argument:dat \nNote: at current, parameter distributions can only be all-exponential or all-normal. Future version of PKPDsim will allow specification per parameter."},"covariates.html":{"url":"covariates.html","title":"Covariates","keywords":"","body":"CovariatesCovariates are implemented using the new_covariate() function, wrapped in a named list. E.g. the following is the most basic specification:dat \nThe names in the covariate list-object should correspond exactly with the names of the covariates in the model.Time-varying covariatesTime-varing covariates, such as creatinine values can be implemented easily as well. They just require the additional times argument:dat \nBy default, PKPDsim assumes that you want to interpolate between measurements of the time-varying covariates. If you prefer to implement the covariate using last-observation-carried-forward (in other words a step function), specify the method = \"LOCF\" argument to the new_covariate() function.Covariates for multiple patientsA table of covariates can be supplied to sim_ode() with covariate values per individual. It can handle both static and time-varying covariates. A covariate table could look like this:id  WT   SCR  t\n1   40   50   0\n1   45  150   5\n2   50   90   0\n3   60  110   0\nThe id and t (time) columns can be omitted when only static covariates are to be used. Make sure that the headers used for the covariates match exactly with the covariate names specified in the model definition.With the above data.frame called cov_table, the call to sim_ode() would then become:sim_ode(ode = model, parameters = parameters, regimen = regimen,\n        covariates_table = cov_table)\nA full example for a model with (simulated) covariates for a patient population would be:library(PKPDsim)\nparameters \nNote: at current, PKPDsim does not handle missing covariate values.

The latter library is a complimentary library to PKPDsim and makes it easy and fast to create the most common plots for PKPD simulations.Using ggplotThe output dataset from sim_ode() can be fed into ggplot2 without modification, use either:ggplot(dat, aes(x = t, y = y, group=id)) + geom_line()\nor using the dplyr / magittr approach:dat %>% ggplot(aes(x = t, y = y, group=id)) + geom_line()\nIf you used the option only_obs=FALSE (which is default), then you will have observations from all compartments in your dataset. Hence, you will have to facet the plot to make separate plots per compartment:ggplot(dat, aes(x = t, y = y, group=id)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~comp)\nUsing PKPDplotWhile ggplot2 is extremely versatile and can basically make any plot of your data that you dream of, most often you'll probably just want a simple plot of the PK profile for a single patient or an overview of the population, e.g. with a confidence interval. The add-on library PKPDplot (available from GitHub) takes away most of the burden of creating these standard plots. It will only show observations, and automatically switch between a plot for a single individual and a population. The plot can be customized using the show argument, as is shown in the examples below.The library is installed from GitHub:devtools::install_github(\"ronkeizer/PKPDplot\")\nAfter loading the library PKPDplot, the plot() function will be extended with a specific plotting function for datasets of created by PKPDsim. Create a plot using simply:library(PKPDplot)\nplot(dat)    \norlibrary(PKPDplot)\ndat %>% plot()\nCustomization optionsVarious customization options allow you to include or hide elements in the plot. They can be specified using the show_single and show_population arguments for plots for data for single or multiple individuals, respectively. For example:plot(dat, show_population(\n  obs = TRUE, spaghetti = FALSE,\n  ci = TRUE, median = TRUE,\n  regimen = TRUE))    \nto show a plot for a population, with the observed concentrations as points and also a confidence interval and median line. The regimen option decides whether the doses are shown as a line (bolus) or box (infuion) in the plot.The defaults are:show_single = list(\n  obs = TRUE,\n  spaghetti = TRUE,\n  ci = FALSE,\n  median = FALSE,\n  regimen = TRUE\n)\n\nshow_population = list(\n  obs = FALSE,\n  spaghetti = TRUE,\n  ci = FALSE,\n  median = TRUE,\n  regimen = TRUE\n)\nTheming optionsBesides showing/hiding elements in the plot, the elements can also be styled using the new_plot_theme() function and the theme argument. An example is shown below:plot(dat,\n  theme = new_plot_theme(\n    ci_fill         = rgb(0.8, 0.5, 0.8, 0.2),\n    median_color    = rgb(0.15, 0.2, 0.6, 0.6),\n    obs_size        = 1,\n    obs_color       = rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0.5)\n  )\n)\nThe defaults are:spaghetti_color = rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5),\ndose_fill       = rgb(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2),\ntarget_fill     = rgb(0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.15),\ntarget_color    = rgb(0.4, 0, 0, 0.5),\nci_fill         = rgb(0.8, 0.5, 0.8, 0.2),\nmedian_color    = rgb(0.15, 0.2, 0.6, 0.6),\nobs_size        = 2,\nobs_color       = rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5)\nFor more elaborate theming of these and other plot elements, please use the options available in ggplot2. You can e.g. add a specific theme on top of the standard call to plot():plot(dat) + theme_bw()\nwhere theme_bw is a ggplot2 theme (theme_bw is a default theme, but you can easily create your own)."},"export-model.html":{"url":"export-model.html","title":"Export model","keywords":"","body":"Export modelPKPDsim allows you to export your ODE model to a precompiled R package. The benefit of doing so is that compilation (which usually takes 3-5 seconds) has to be done only when the package is created, and not when it is reloaded into R. This is useful for example when you want to create a Shiny app using a PKPDsim model, as it will remove the delay due to the compilation when starting the Shiny app. You can export to a package using the package argument to new_ode_model. With the install option you can control whether the package should be installed into R (default), or exported to a zip-file (install=FALSE).
