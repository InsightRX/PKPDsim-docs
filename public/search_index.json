documentationPKPDsim is an R package for numerical integration of ODE systems, in particular pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) mixed-effects models.In pharmacometrics, models are often defined as systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Although solving ODEs numerically in R is relatively straightforward using e.g. the deSolve library, the implementation of e.g. infusions and complex dosing regimens as well as the incorporation of random effects is cumbersome. Outside of R, a tool like Berkeley Madonna provides excellent interactivity features and is fast, but is much inferior to R regarding plotting functionality, cumbersome regarding implementation of dose regimens and multi-level variability, and also not open source.In short, the issues above were the impetus for developing the PKPDsim library in R. For fast numerical integration of the ODEs, the module uses the Boost C++ library under the hood.If this library is useful to you in your company or academic work, please let me know at @ronpirana. For any suggestions on new features or to report any bugs, please don't send me emails but open an issue on GitHub.PKPDsim is released under the MIT open source license."},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting started","keywords":"","body":"Getting startedInstallationAt current, PKPDsim is not yet on CRAN (but it will be released to there soon).

However, the package can be installed directly from GitHub when you have the devtools package installed:library(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"ronkeizer/PKPDsim\")\nlibrary(PKPDsim)\nFirst simulationThe main simulation function in PKPDsim is sim_ode(). To be able to simulate a dosing regimen for a specific drug, at least the following three arguments are required:model: the model (created using the new_ode_model() function)\n\nparameters: a list of parameter values for the model\n\nregimen: the dosing regimen (created using the new_regimen() function)\n\nThe model library in PKPDsim contains a small selection of PK and PD models, but the main strength of course is it's ability to handle user-specified ODE systems. However, as a first example, let's implement the most simple example:p \nYou probably noticed that the new_ode_model()-step took a few seconds to finish, while the simulation itself was in the order of milliseconds. In new_ode_model, the model is compiled to C++ binary code, which takes a few seconds. However, this has to be done only once. After compilation, the model is then available to be used in sim_ode() for as long as the R session is open.So let's look at the output. PKPDsim will output data in the long format, i.e. one row per observed timepoint and split by compartment:> head(dat)\n  id t comp         y\n1  1 0    1 100.00000\n2  1 1    1  60.65307\n3  1 2    1  36.78794\n4  1 3    1  22.31302\n5  1 4    1  13.53353\n6  1 5    1   8.20850\nTo check whether our simulation actually produced results, let's plot it (installation of ggplot2 required).ggplot(dat, aes(x=t, y=y)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~comp)\n"},"documentation.html":{"url":"documentation.html","title":"General","keywords":"","body":"DocumentationThe most important functions within PKPDsim are:\n\n Function \n Description \n\n new_ode_model() \n create a new ODE system to be used in sim_ode() \n new_regimen() \n create a new regimen to be used in sim_ode() \n new_covariate() \n create a new covariate definition \n sim_ode() \n the main simulation function\n\n\nThese functions will be addressed in the following sections"},"model.html":{"url":"model.html","title":"Model","keywords":"","body":"Modelnew_ode_model is the function that creates a new ODE model that can be used in the sim_ode() command.

PKPDsim does not translate those from the pseudo-R code to valid C++ syntax automatically. C/C++ does not use the ^ to indicate power functions but uses the pow(value, base) function instead, so e.g. an allometric model should be written as:pk1 \nDosingThe default dosing compartment and bioavailability can be specified using the dose argument. By default, the dose will go into compartment 1, with a bioavailability of 1.

The add-on library PKPDplot (available from GitHub) takes away most of the burden of creating these standard plots. It will only show observations, and automatically switch between a plot for a single individual and a population. The plot can be customized using the show argument, as is shown in the examples below.The library is installed from GitHub:devtools::install_github(\"ronkeizer/PKPDplot\")\nAfter loading the library PKPDplot, the plot() function will be extended with a specific plotting function for datasets of created by PKPDsim. Create a plot using simply:library(PKPDplot)\nplot(dat)    \norlibrary(PKPDplot)\ndat %>% plot()\nCustomization optionsVarious customization options allow you to include or hide elements in the plot. They can be specified using the show_single and show_population arguments for plots for data for single or multiple individuals, respectively. For example:plot(dat, show_population(\n  obs = TRUE, spaghetti = FALSE,\n  ci = TRUE, median = TRUE,\n  regimen = TRUE))    \nto show a plot for a population, with the observed concentrations as points and also a confidence interval and median line. The regimen option decides whether the doses are shown as a line (bolus) or box (infuion) in the plot.The defaults are:show_single = list(\n  obs = TRUE,\n  spaghetti = TRUE,\n  ci = FALSE,\n  median = FALSE,\n  regimen = TRUE\n)\n\nshow_population = list(\n  obs = FALSE,\n  spaghetti = TRUE,\n  ci = FALSE,\n  median = TRUE,\n  regimen = TRUE\n)\nTheming optionsBesides showing/hiding elements in the plot, the elements can also be styled using the new_plot_theme() function and the theme argument.

Therefore, for most simulation problems computational speed will not be an issue. Even simulating thousands (or millions) of patients for complex models will rarely take more than a few minutes. Simpler simulation problems will commonly take seconds to complete.However, in some special cases speed could become an issue, and for that it is important to understand the structure of PKPDsim's main function (sim_ode()) because. The sim_ode() function is composed of three parts:preprocessing (R)\n\nlooping over subjects, solving ODE for each subject (R/C++)\n\npost-processing (R)\n\nFrom this structure it is easy to understand that when you would request simulation of 1,000 patients:dat \nthe pre- and post-processing parts will take relatively minor computational time, since the main part will be the loop simulating the PK for the subjects. However, if instead you would write a loop yourself to simulate 1,000 patients, and would call sim_ode() repeatedly:dat \nnow in each iteration also the pre- and post-processing functionality would be invoked, and the overall simulation will take much longer than before, probably by an order of magnitude. The same concept applies if you would use sim_ode() in the context of population (NLME) or individual (MAP) estimation, or in optimal design in evaluation of the FIM.There is a different way to solve ODEs with PKPDsim though, which uses only the core ODE solver function and does not perform pre-/post-processing. If you need to use PKPDsim in an iterative context as described above, you should therefore use the sim_core() function instead, and perform the pre- and post-processing outside of the main loop, e.g.:design \nComparison with other packagesThe R package RxODE implements a similar approach (i.e. overhead from pre- / post-processing separated from main simulation function) by default, while mrgsolve is more similar to PKPDsim with much overhead inside the main simulation function. Therefore, especially when used in an iterative context, RxODE will be much faster than PKDPsim and mrgsolve by default, while PKPDsim and mrgsolve are broadly similar in terms of speed.
