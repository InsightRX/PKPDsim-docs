documentation\nPKPDsim is an R package for numerical integration of ODE systems, in particular pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) mixed-effects models.\nIn pharmacometrics, models are often defined as systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Although solving ODEs numerically in R is relatively straightforward using e.g. the deSolve library, the implementation of e.g. infusions and complex dosing regimens as well as the incorporation of random effects is cumbersome. Outside of R, a tool like Berkeley Madonna provides excellent interactivity features and is fast, but is much inferior to R regarding plotting functionality, cumbersome regarding implementation of dose regimens and multi-level variability, and also not open source.\nIn short, the issues above were the impetus for developing the PKPDsim library in R. For fast numerical integration of the ODEs, the module uses the Boost C++ library under the hood.\nIf this library is useful to you in your company or academic work, please let me know at @ronpirana. For any suggestions on new features or to report any bugs, please don't send me emails but open an issue on GitHub.\nPKPDsim is released under the MIT open source license.\n"},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting started","keywords":"","body":"Getting started\nInstallation\nAt current, PKPDsim is not yet on CRAN (but it will be released to there soon). So you cannot use install.packages() yet to install it. However, the package can be installed directly from GitHub when you have the devtools package installed:\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"ronkeizer/PKPDsim\")\nlibrary(PKPDsim)\nFirst simulation\nThe main simulation function in PKPDsim is sim_ode(). To be able to simulate a dosing regimen for a specific drug, at least the following three arguments are required:\n\nmodel: the model (created using the new_ode_model() function)\nparameters: a list of parameter values for the model\nregimen: the dosing regimen (created using the new_regimen() function)\n\nThe model library in PKPDsim contains a small selection of PK and PD models, but the main strength of course is it's ability to handle user-specified ODE systems. However, as a first example, let's implement the most simple example:\np You probably noticed that the new_ode_model()-step took a few seconds to finish, while the simulation itself was in the order of milliseconds. In new_ode_model, the model is compiled to C++ binary code, which takes a few seconds. However, this has to be done only once. After compilation, the model is then available to be used in sim_ode() for as long as the R session is open.\nSo let's look at the output. PKPDsim will output data in the long format, i.e. one row per observed timepoint and split by compartment:\n> head(dat)\n  id t comp         y\n1  1 0    1 100.00000\n2  1 1    1  60.65307\n3  1 2    1  36.78794\n4  1 3    1  22.31302\n5  1 4    1  13.53353\n6  1 5    1   8.20850\nTo check whether our simulation actually produced results, let's plot it (installation of ggplot2 required).\nggplot(dat, aes(x=t, y=y)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~comp)\n"},"documentation.html":{"url":"documentation.html","title":"General","keywords":"","body":"Documentation\nThe most important functions within PKPDsim are:\n\n\n\nFunction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnew_ode_model()\ncreate a new ODE system to be used in sim_ode()\n\n\nnew_regimen()\ncreate a new regimen to be used in sim_ode()\n\n\nnew_covariate()\ncreate a new covariate definition\n\n\nsim_ode()\nthe main simulation function\n\n\n\nThese functions will be addressed in the following sections\n"},"model.html":{"url":"model.html","title":"Model","keywords":"","body":"Model\nnew_ode_model is the function that creates a new ODE model that can be used in the sim_ode() command. It defines the ODE system and sets some attributes for the model. The model can be specified in three different ways:\n\nmodel: a string that references a model from the library included in PKPDsim. Examples in the current library are e.g. pk_1cmt_oral, pk_2cmt_iv. To show the available models, run new_ode_model() without any arguments.\ncode: using code specyfing derivatives for ODE specified in pseudo-R code\nfile: similar to code, but reads the code from a file\n\nModel from library\nFor example, a 1-compartment oral PK model can be obtained using:\npk1 Run the new_ode_model() function without arguments to see the currently available models:\n> new_ode_model()\n  Either a model name (from the PKPDsim library), ODE code, an R function, or\n  a file containing code for the ODE system have to be supplied to this function.\n  The following models are available:\n  pk_1cmt_iv\n  pk_1cmt_iv_auc\n  pk_1cmt_iv_mm\n  pk_2cmt_iv\n  pk_2cmt_iv_auc\n  pk_1cmt_oral\nCustom model from code\nThe custom model needs to be specified as a string or text block:\npk1 The input code should adhere to the follow rules:\n\nthe derivaties in the ODE system are defined using dAdt\narray indices for the derivatives and compartments are indicated with [ ] and start at 1.\nequations are defined using =\nsome expections apply, e.g. power functions (see below).\n\nThe input code is translated into a C++ function.

PKPDsim does not translate those from the pseudo-R code to valid C++ syntax automatically. C/C++ does not use the ^ to indicate power functions but uses the pow(value, base) function instead, so e.g. an allometric model should be written as:\npk1 Dosing / bioavailability\nThe default dosing compartment and bioavailability can be specified using the dose argument. By default, the dose will go into compartment 1, with a bioavailability of 1. The bioav element in the list can be either a number or a character string referring a parameter.\npk1 For dosing based on mg/kg, at currently there is no solution for that using new_regimen(), although that might change in the future. The way to implement this at the moment is by scaling the dose by the \"weight\" covariate using the bioavailability:\nmod Observations\nThe observation compartment can be set by specifying a list to the obs argument, with the elements obs and scale.\npk1 The scale can be either a parameter or a number, the cmt can only be a number.\nNote that the variables specified inside the differential equation block are not available as scaling parameters. E.g. for allometry you will have to redefine the scaled volume as follows:\npk1 Custom model from file\nThe same syntax as explained above applies, but using the file= argument the input code is read from the specified file. This is just a convenience function, i.e. it allows you to modularize your code, and separate models and R code.\npk1 "},"regimen.html":{"url":"regimen.html","title":"Regimen","keywords":"","body":"Regimen\nRegimens are defined using the new_regimen() function. You should provide information on the dose amount, how many doses, and the dosing interval. However, how you provide that information is very flexible.

The same can however also be specified as:\nreg1 or:\nreg1 Be careful: if the length of the amt vector is not the same as the lenght in times, the function will repeat the first amt specified. The same goes for the arguments type, cmt, and t_inf.\nBy default, the new_regimen_function() function assumes the dose is given as bolus. If you want to specify that these should be given as infusion, specify the type and t_inf arguments:\nreg1 When you created the model using new_ode_model, you also specified a default dosing compartment. If you didn't specify the dose argument, the default dosing compartment is 1. Now, should you want to administer the dose into a different compartment, you can override it with the cmt argumentfunction:\nreg1 Which will administer the doses to compartments 1, 1, 2, 2, and 3, respectively (of course this is a hypothetical example).\nNote: PKPDsim doesn't care about what unit the dose is in, you have to define this yourself in conjunction with the model code and observation scale.\nSteady state\nInstead of simulating the full concentration time course for a give model,\nif you want to simulate the PK(PD) at steady state, you can also specify\nthe ss=TRUE argument to new_regimen(), which will then simulate the\nregimen at steady state. By default, steady state is assumed to occur after\n5 days (PKPDsim doesn't check if steady state is reached!), but if you want\nto decrease or increase this you can do so by specifying the n_ss argument\nwhich takes the number of doses to simulate before assuming steady state.\n"},"parameters.html":{"url":"parameters.html","title":"Parameters","keywords":"","body":"Parameters\nParameters are just specified as a list object in R.

An alternative option is to specify the between-subject variability as CV, using the cv_to_omega() function, but this assumes there is no correlation between parameters.\nThe following:\ndat will simulate out data for 50 patients, assuming an Omega matrix as defined above. ALternatively, the \\Omega could also have been defined as:\ndat Or using the coefficient of variation and without correlation between parameters:\ndat Note that using the cv_to_omega function assumes the CV is on the SD-scale and not on the variance scale (and the definition of CV uses the assumption 1 + \\eta \\approx 1 * \\exp(\\eta)).\nVariability type\nBy default, PKPDsim will assume exponential distribution of all parameters if omega is specified.

Future version of PKPDsim will allow specification per parameter.\nMore flexible variability models\nTo allow more flexibility in how between-subject variability enters the model, there is an alternative way of specifying variability. This approach is very similar to the way variability is encoded in NONMEM, i.e. variability components (eta's) are added explicitly in the model code. In PKPDsim this means that eta's should be treated just like regular parameters, but with 0 mean and normal distribution.

The latter library is a complimentary library to PKPDsim and makes it easy and fast to create the most common plots for PKPD simulations.\nUsing ggplot\nThe output dataset from sim_ode() can be fed into ggplot2 without modification, use either:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = t, y = y, group=id)) + geom_line()\nor using the dplyr / magittr approach:\ndat %>% ggplot(aes(x = t, y = y, group=id)) + geom_line()\nIf you used the option only_obs=FALSE (which is default), then you will have observations from all compartments in your dataset.

The add-on library PKPDplot (available from GitHub) takes away most of the burden of creating these standard plots. It will only show observations, and automatically switch between a plot for a single individual and a population. The plot can be customized using the show argument, as is shown in the examples below.\nThe library is installed from GitHub:\ndevtools::install_github(\"ronkeizer/PKPDplot\")\nAfter loading the library PKPDplot, the plot() function will be extended with a specific plotting function for datasets of created by PKPDsim. Create a plot using simply:\nlibrary(PKPDplot)\nplot(dat)    \nor\nlibrary(PKPDplot)\ndat %>% plot()\nCustomization options\nVarious customization options allow you to include or hide elements in the plot. They can be specified using the show_single and show_population arguments for plots for data for single or multiple individuals, respectively. For example:\nplot(dat, show_population(\n  obs = TRUE, spaghetti = FALSE,\n  ci = TRUE, median = TRUE,\n  regimen = TRUE))    \nto show a plot for a population, with the observed concentrations as points and also a confidence interval and median line.

Therefore, for most simulation problems computational speed will not be an issue. Even simulating thousands (or millions) of patients for complex models will rarely take more than a few minutes. Simpler simulation problems will commonly take seconds to complete.\nHowever, in some special cases speed could become an issue, and for that it is important to understand the structure of PKPDsim's main function (sim_ode()) because. The sim_ode() function is composed of three parts:\n\npreprocessing (R)\nlooping over subjects, solving ODE for each subject (R/C++)\npost-processing (R)\n\nFrom this structure it is easy to understand that when you would request simulation of 1,000 patients:\ndat the pre- and post-processing parts will take relatively minor computational time, since the main part will be the loop simulating the PK for the subjects. However, if instead you would write a loop yourself to simulate 1,000 patients, and would call sim_ode() repeatedly:\ndat now in each iteration also the pre- and post-processing functionality would be invoked, and the overall simulation will take much longer than before, probably by an order of magnitude. The same concept applies if you would use sim_ode() in the context of population (NLME) or individual (MAP) estimation, or in optimal design in evaluation of the FIM.\nThere is a different way to solve ODEs with PKPDsim though, which uses only the core ODE solver function and does not perform pre-/post-processing. If you need to use PKPDsim in an iterative context as described above, you should therefore use the sim_core() function instead, and perform the pre- and post-processing outside of the main loop, e.g.:\ndesign Comparison with other packages\nThe R package RxODE implements a similar approach (i.e. overhead from pre- / post-processing separated from main simulation function) by default, while mrgsolve is more similar to PKPDsim with much overhead inside the main simulation function. Therefore, especially when used in an iterative context, RxODE will be much faster than PKDPsim and mrgsolve by default, while PKPDsim and mrgsolve are broadly similar in terms of speed.
