documentationPKPDsim is an R package for numerical integration of ODE systems, in particular pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) mixed-effects models.In pharmacometrics, models are often defined as systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Although solving ODEs numerically in R is relatively straightforward using e.g. the deSolve library, the implementation of e.g. infusions and complex dosing regimens as well as the incorporation of random effects is cumbersome. Outside of R, a tool like Berkeley Madonna provides excellent interactivity features and is fast, but is much inferior to R regarding plotting functionality, cumbersome regarding implementation of dose regimens and multi-level variability, and also not open source.In short, the issues above were the impetus for developing the PKPDsim library in R. For fast numerical integration of the ODEs, the module uses the Boost C++ library under the hood.If this library is useful to you in your company or academic work, please let me know at @ronpirana. For any suggestions on new features or to report any bugs, please don't send me emails but open an issue on GitHub.PKPDsim is released under the MIT open source license."},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting started","keywords":"","body":"Getting startedInstallationAt current, PKPDsim is not yet on CRAN (but it will be released to there soon). So you cannot use install.packages() yet to install it. However, the package can be installed directly from GitHub when you have the devtools package installed:\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"ronkeizer/PKPDsim\")\nlibrary(PKPDsim)\nFirst simulationThe main simulation function in PKPDsim is sim_ode(). To be able to simulate a dosing regimen for a specific drug, at least the following three arguments are required:model: the model (created using the new_ode_model() function)\n\nparameters: a list of parameter values for the model\n\nregimen: the dosing regimen (created using the new_regimen() function)\n\nThe model library in PKPDsim contains a small selection of PK and PD models, but the main strength of course is it's ability to handle user-specified ODE systems. However, as a first example, let's implement the most simple example:p \nYou probably noticed that the new_ode_model()-step took a few seconds to finish, while the simulation itself was in the order of milliseconds. In new_ode_model, the model is compiled to C++ binary code, which takes a few seconds. However, this has to be done only once. After compilation, the model is then available to be used in sim_ode() for as long as the R session is open.So let's look at the output.

It defines the ODE system and sets some attributes for the model. The model can be specified in three different ways:model: a string that references a model from the library included in PKPDsim. Examples in the current library are e.g. pk_1cmt_oral, pk_2cmt_iv. To show the available models, run new_ode_model() without any arguments.\n\ncode: using code specyfing derivatives for ODE specified in pseudo-R code\n\nfile: similar to code, but reads the code from a file\n\nModel from libraryE.g.:pk1 \nCustom model from codeThe custom model needs to be specified as a string or text block:pk1 \nThe input code should adhere to the follow rules:the derivaties in the ODE system are defined using dAdt\n\narray indices for the derivatives and compartments are indicated with [ ] and start at 1.\n\nequations are defined using =\n\nsome expections apply, e.g. power functions (see below).\n\nThe input code is translated into a C++ function.

PKPDsim does not translate those from the pseudo-R code to valid C++ syntax automatically. C/C++ does not use the ^ to indicate power functions but uses the pow(value, base) function instead, so e.g. an allometric model should be written as:pk1 \nDosingThe default dosing compartment and bioavailability can be specified using the dose argument. By default, the dose will go into compartment 1, with a bioavailability of 1. The bioav element in the list can be either a number or a character string referring a parameter.pk1 \nObservationsThe observation compartment can be set by specifying a list to the obs argument, with the elements obs and scale.pk1 \nThe scale can be either a parameter or a number, the cmt can only be a number.Note that the variables specified inside the differential equation block are not available as scaling parameters. E.g. for allometry you will have to redefine the scaled volume as follows:pk1 \nCustom model from fileThe same syntax as explained above applies, but using the file= argument the input code is read from the specified file.

The same can however also be specified as:reg1 \nor:reg1 \nBe careful: if the length of the amt vector is not the same as the lenght in times, the function will repeat the first amt specified.
