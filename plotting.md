# Plotting

Although data generated with `PKPDsim` can of course be plotted with any plotting library, some guidance is given below for plotting the data with `ggplot2` and with the `PKPDplot` library (based on `ggplot2`). The latter library is a complimentary library to `PKPDsim` and makes it easy and fast to create the most common plots for PKPD simulations.
